rules = "Here are the rules: two players secretly pick one of \"rock,\" \"paper,\"or \"scissors.\" \
Both players reveal their selection to the other player at once; the winner is chosen \
based on what the selections are. Rock beats scissors (by crushing them); scissors\
beats paper (by cutting it); and paper beats rock (by covering it). If both players\
select the same one, it is a tie"
